## Project Description
This is a project that has 3 programs that each have their unique function. 
The first program is student grade generator, the second program is a speed detector and the third program is a net salary calculator.

## Project SetUp 
 The project is set up in 3 files as follows:

challenge1.js  Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

This is a program that prompts the user to input the student marks. The input should range between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows:
A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.


challenge2.js   Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

This is a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

challenge3.js Net Salary Calculator(Toy Problem)

This is a program that given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, it calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF,NSSF Deductions and net salary.
